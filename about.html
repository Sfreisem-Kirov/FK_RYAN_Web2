        <h2>Our Founding</h2>
        <p>Yaakov Yamikah’s comes from a Jewish immigrant to Israel. My grandfather, Yaakov, first came to Israel in 1948 with
            ten rubles in his pocket. He started selling yamikahs to the local synagogue. He infused classic yamikah designs
            with American or Russian or African fashion designs. Quickly, Yaakov Yamikahs became the most popular yamikahs
            in all of Israel. Legend has it, that every prime minister of Israel owns one. Yaakov’s Yamikah’s became a symbol
            of Israel becoming an International state and being a part of the world not only politically, but in fashion
            and culture. Be a part of not only Israel, but the world when you wear one of Yaakov’s Yamikah’s. </p>
        <p>Yaakov also came with his family and first began working at a Yamikah factory, this is where he learned how to make
            them. Below is a photo of his family and factory. </p>
